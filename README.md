##### A simple irc bot which detects urls and prints titles

- Supports utf-8 titles, so japanfags are happy
- Prints colored titles
- Sometimes it seems intelligent
- Knows many proverbs
- Dunno

It requires nokogiri and cinch:

- gem install nokogiri
- gem install cinch
- gem install cinch-login (Thanks to RoxasShadowRS)
