##### A simple irc bot which detects youtube links and prints relative video title

- Supports utf-8 titles, so jappofags are happy
- Prints colored titles
- Says hi like a renaissance gentleman

It needs nokogiri and cinch:

- gem install nokogiri
- gem install cinch
- gem install cinch-login (Thanks to RoxasShadowRS)
